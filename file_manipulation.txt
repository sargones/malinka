Let's try to play with thislet us see if the with statement is working
 do we have now new line creating?
 last line before closing the file
and let me wish you a nice week


-----
code use for appending and closing file:
with open('/home/pi/Python/testfile.txt', mode = 'at', encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
	f.write('\nand let me wish you a nice week')

def writeMyFile(add_to_file):
	with open('/home/pi/Python/testfile.txt', mode = 'at', encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
	    f.write('\n')
	    f.write(add_to_file)
